# Science-based games

Here is a collaborative notepad with educational/science games, i.e. games that are:

* capturing parts of a real scientific phenomena,
* actually playable (you can play them for fun, not ones from the *"for classroom only"* category).

This list was started by [Piotr Migdał](http://p.migdal.pl/) (the author of [Quantum Game with Photons](http://quantumgame.io/)), everyone is welcomed to contribute! (The easiest way is to edit this file, commit and create a Pull Request.)

A mini table of content: [Physics](#physics), [Biology](#biology), [Computer Science](#computer-science), [Health](#health), [Mathematics](#mathematics), [Sociology and economy](#sociology-and-economy), [Humanities](#humanities)

## Meta / TODO

* Do it in YAML? (To make it more semantic.)
* Make it more visual? (In the line of https://github.com/EliotAndres/kaggle-past-solutions.)
* Add other fields like release date or dev status?
* Add some standardized (600x400?) screenshots?
