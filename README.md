# Science-based games

> The list is essentially about educational based games that nailed entertainment (with a focus on scientific phenomenon). - [mettamage on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14661821)

Here is a collaborative notepad with educational/science games, i.e. games that are:

* capturing parts of real scientific phenomena (including social science, medicine, etc),
* actually playable (you can play them for fun, not ones *"for classroom only"*).

So in general, ones that may make you say *I played X for its own sake, yet I've learnt how Y works!* for Y being advanced enough.

This is a collaborative list dedicated to the public domain ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)), where everyone is welcomed to contribute! See: [how to contribute](#how-to-contribute). It was started, and is being maintained, by [Piotr Migda≈Ç](http://p.migdal.pl/) (the author of [Quantum Game with Photons](http://quantumgame.io/)).

### Life experience games

There are a few games that *feel* somewhat related (even if not that much science-based).
I (@stared) considered putting them in psychology/sociology, but it turned out to be a controversial issue.
Again, what is crucial - it's not about only about theme, but game mechanics aligned with experiencing a difficult life siutation.

## Meta

### How to contribute

#### Content

The easiest way is to edit this file, commit and create a Pull Request.

Remember to include:

* working link (and its nicer version), e.g. `[immunology-fps.edu](https://immunology-fps.edu)`
* field of science or enginering, e.g. `immunology`
* type of game `first-person shooter`
* (optional) technology or system, e.g. `Android, iOS, web`
* (optional) link to additional materials (e.g. repo, some interesting blog post about this game)

A game needs to fit this category and it needs to have science-based mechanics (not only theme!) as its major part as:

> Any sufficiently advanced game is indistinguishable from a science-based game. - [PM, HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14662356)

Also, for games from typical genres, the bar is much higher. It is not enough that "you learn about ancient warfare" or "you explore outer space".
As a rule of thumb, mainstream games don't fit here (with the exception of Kerbal Space Program).

When a game is free ([as in freedom, not price](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)), the license and code repository will be stated when possible. Please note that unless otherwise stated, the game is proprietary *or* a license can't be found.

#### Form

If you want to change its form, you are invited as well - but then create your fork (and I would be happy to hear about it!).

All remarks, questions or discussions go to https://github.com/stared/science-based-games-list/issues/ (or [@pmigdal Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmigdal)).

### Ideas

* Do it in YAML? (To make it more semantic.)
* Make it more visual? (In the line of https://github.com/EliotAndres/kaggle-past-solutions.)
* Add other fields like release date or dev status?
* Add some standardized (600x400?) screenshots?
